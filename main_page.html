				    <p>Looking at the logo and wondering what this page can be about? Well, it’s about ‘building blocks’. This pandemic has hit us hard. And I was at home all the time.
					Too many thoughts - and I started an art account -> it has 
					a reason and history behind it. Believe me, I had some amazing learnings and 
					this page is it share my experience.</p>
				    <p>And yes! This is the first responsive webpage that I built from scratch. Did a small course on basic Html, CSS, javascript 
					and thought I should definitely build one. And here it is!</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">How did it start</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>I have always loved drawing. In fact, I never cared about how it would turn out, never had thoughts like - "what am i drawing?!" - i used to just
  take a paper and pencil and draw!</p>
  <p>Over time, I started drawing less, I didn't find time to. When I got into my engineering course, I felt like I should draw again, I missed it! I joined the art 
  club, where I got to improve my skill a lot, and managed to get into the university team :)</p>
  <p>But then, something made me unhappy and I figured out that it was the pressure of ‘making good drawings’ that I was putting on myself. And as a result, I didn’t 
  draw more. The improvement in my work started decreasing too. Needed a break, but did not want to stop drawing. That is when I found the ‘100 days of sketching challenge’ 
  on Instagram. It’s all about drawing every day to level up our drawing skills! I started it on May 10 after a big debate with myself over starting an Instagram page ( I am 
  kind of scared to express myself because I always had the thought that people might judge, in this case, my drawings. I convinced myself that this was a way to overcome this 
  and make myself better, and it did help!). And yes! This is how it started - drawing everyday : )</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">How did it go</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The experience of drawing every day was great! I made sure that I did draw something for six minutes or scribble at least, did all kinds of good drawings, bad drawings, 
  experimented a bit - and completed 100 days! ( i have a big smile on my face right now). I realized that I couldn’t draw from my imagination at all! And I lacked good basics.</p>
  <p>I immediately took up a small course (Begin drawing - by Keshav Ratnavel sir) and started things from basics again, Took up the begin drawing challenge and won it : D
Doing this made me care less about the outcome and concentrate more on drawing.
</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">What did I learn from this journey?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>- When you put effort into it, it never goes wated. Like... With the 100 days of sketching, I didn’t learn anything new or level up my drawing skills, but I formed a habit 
  of drawing at least some lines each day. Doing this gave me a huge push to learn drawing the right way. After taking lessons in drawing camp, when I tried to draw something ( 
  not my own ), this time, I could notice different new things in it, like the light and shadow and combination of shapes and forms in it! That is when I realized that I was making 
  small unnoticed improvement every day : ) </p>
  <p> - Consistency matters in everything!</p>
  <p>- When you want things to be done, all you need to do is to start! That’s the most important step. Start, work for it every day. Spending 6 hrs on a day and doing nothing for 
  a week is the way practice works. We need to do little every day - little things every day add up. And that is the philosophy behind building blocks - build a little every day - 
  just a little - it works wonders.</p>
  <p>- Always think simple! - even the most complex things can be broken down into small ones - just like any complex drawing is built of shapes and forms.</p>
  <p>- Regarding the quality or quantity debate, I believe that quantity (lots of small things done with interest) will slowly lead to quality someday - and that is what I am aiming 
  for!</p>
  <p>- Do a little to build a skill that you love/ want to learn - do a little everyday - spend time on things you love. Be patient and stay positive.
  Little things are important and consistency matters.</p>
