# building-blocks

Hello!

This is my try to create a web page from scratch.

You can view the the page at - https://e-aditi.github.io/building-blocks/  (Thanks to github pages, i have hosted it)

Click on it and find out what the page is all about!


I have done a small course on responsive web page design on coursera, and i have referred to a lot of pages online to create this. Most of them are from:

https://www.w3schools.com/html/

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-introduction/

And some of the sites are mentions in the mystyle.css file. Hope these help you too!
